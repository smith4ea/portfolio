# Evan Smith UX Engineer Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a UX designer rediscovering my love for full stack development. This repository will hopefully showcase projects that blend thoughtful design with clean, functional code.

## About Me

I spent the last 5 years as a UX designer, learning how to think about user needs, craft intuitive interfaces, and solve problems through design. Now I'm refreshing my development skills and building full stack applications from the ground up. This portfolio is my journey back into code expect projects that prioritize both aesthetics and user experience.

## Tech Stack TBD

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind, Vite
- **Backend**: TBD
- **Databases**: TBD
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, VSCode, Cursor, Claude
- **Icons** https://heroicons.com/

## Goals for This Portfolio

- Rebuild full stack development fundamentals
- Create a portfolio that demonstrates full stack capability
- Document my learning process
- Demonstrate ability to ship (questionable) quality code and design
