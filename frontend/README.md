# Evan Smith UX Engineer Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a UX designer rediscovering my love for full stack development. This repository will hopefully showcase projects that blend thoughtful design with clean, functional code.

## About Me

I spent the last 5 years as a UX designer, learning how to think about user needs, craft intuitive interfaces, and solve problems through design. Now I'm refreshing my development skills and building full stack applications from the ground up. This portfolio is my journey back into code expect projects that prioritize both aesthetics and user experience.

## Tech Stack TBD

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind, Vite
- **Backend**: TBD
- **Databases**: TBD
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, VSCode, Cursor, Claude

## Goals for This Portfolio

- Rebuild full stack development fundamentals
- Create a portfolio that demonstrates full stack capability
- Document my learning process
- Demonstrate ability to ship (questionable) quality code and design

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
